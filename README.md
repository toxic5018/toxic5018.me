## About toxic5018

Hey there! I'm **toxic5018**, a passionate and detail-driven developer who thrives on building digital worlds and experimenting with tech. Whether I'm coding a voxel-based game in Unity, rendering procedural terrain in Three.js, or crafting unique web experiences, I focus on **creativity, performance, and polish**.

I’m fascinated by systems that simulate rich, interactive environments. From sandbox survival mechanics to procedurally generated universes, I love exploring how code can create immersive, rule-based worlds.

Here’s what I often dive into:

- 🌍 **Voxel engines & world generation** (Unity / Three.js)  
- 🔧 **Low-level gameplay systems** like player movement, collision, and survival mechanics  
- 🎮 **Reverse-engineering gameplay behaviors**, especially from games like Minecraft  
- ⚙️ **Efficient, optimized systems** for rendering and interactivity  
- 🧠 Always learning, always refining  

This site—`toxic5018.me`—serves as a personal hub, portfolio, and possibly even a live demo space in the future. It's a testament to my work, my ideas, and the tech I'm passionate about.
